        <h3 class="titulo3"> Objective </h3>
        <p> The objective of Mastermind&reg; is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 or more colored pegs. Each guess results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the code. Black Pegs means there there is 1 or more colored pegs in the correct position. White pegs mean the coloured pegs belong to the code but aren't in their correct positions. The winner is the player who solves his opponent's secret code using fewer guesses. </p>
        <h3 class="titulo3"> Singleplayer </h3>
        <p>In the Singleplayer Mode you play against your computer, in a Man VS Machine battle. A "code" is randomly selected by the game's algorithim and you need to guess it correctly withim the specified number of turns.</p>
        <h3 class="titulo3"> Multiplayer </h3>
        <p>In the Multiplayer Mode you play against your friend, in the same computer, to see who is the best code-breaker. Prior to starting a "code-maker" and "code-breaker" is decided by mutual agreement. After that a code must be choosen by the "code-maker" in the first play of the game. The winner is whoever manages to break the other one's code faster.</p>
        <h3 class="titulo3"> Co-Op </h3>
        <p>In the Co-Op Mode you and your friend must work together in order to solve some of the toughest challenges in Mastermind&reg; . After a code is randomly generated by the Computer, you must solve the code using the lowest ammount of guesses as possible, changing the player on which turn. </p>
         <h3 class="titulo3"> Time Attack </h3>
        <p>In the Time Attack Mode, you must race against time in order to solve the randomly generated code. You only have a limited ammount of time per turn so fast thinking is a must.</p>

    <h3 class="titulo3">Origins</h3>
    <p>It all started with an English code-breaking game know has Bulls and Cows, of unknown origins, played with paper and pencil. Each player writes a secret sequence of four numbers, and the opponent had to guess the correct sequence. Matching digits are called “bulls,” while wrong guesses are “cows”. Some researchers who evidently didn't have anything else to do one day proved that any sequence could be guessed in seven turns.</p>
<p>Although Bulls and Cows is reminiscent of Mastermind, it was only after decades of experimentation and a very creative Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert named Mordecai Meirowitz, that the modern idea of Mastermind was created.</p>

<p>Initially Meirowitz's game idea was rejected by game companies but he finally took it to the International Toy Fair in 1971. There, an English company name Invicta Plastics took interest in it. After small changes to the rules, Invicta Plastics released in the same year under the name “Mastermind”. The game was a hit: 50 million copies were sold in over 80 countries. It was the most popular board game of the decade.</p>
  <h3 class="titulo3">Modern Day</h3>  
<p>Currently, the game has exploded into all kinds of versions. You can play the standard version online or you can play one of the many variations that have been created ever since. A similar version to the original one is used, in popular kids gaming site “Neopets”, called “Time Tunnel”, in which you must break a code to get past a mysterious door covered in symbols. 
Even after decades of history and many variations, Mastermind is still one of the most popular kids board game to date.</p>
